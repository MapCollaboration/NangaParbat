comment: Measurements are presented of the differential cross sections for Z bosons
  produced in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV and decaying to muons and
  electrons. The data analyzed were collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the
  LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb-1. The measured fiducial
  inclusive product of cross section and branching fraction agrees with next-to-next-to-leading
  order quantum chromodynamics calculations. Differential cross sections of the transverse
  momentum pt, the optimized angular variable $\phi^{\scriptscriptstyle *}_\eta$,
  and the rapidity of lepton pairs are measured. The data are corrected for detector
  effects and compared to theoretical predictions using fixed order, resummed, and
  parton shower calculations. The uncertainties of the measured normalized cross sections
  are smaller than 0.5% for $\phi^{\scriptscriptstyle *}_\eta$ $<$ 0.5 and for pt
  $<$ 50 GeV.
