comment: CERN-LHC. This HEPData entry describes precision measurements of the transverse
  momentum $p_{ll}$ (l = e, $\mu$) and of the angular variable $\phi_{\eta}^{*}$ distributions
  of Drell-Yan lepton pairs in a mass range of 66-116 GeV. The analysis uses data
  from 36.1 $fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt(s)$
  = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. Measurements
  in electron-pair and muon-pair final state are performed in the same fiducial volumes,
  corrected for detector effects, and combined. Compared to previous measurements
  in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt(s)$ = 7 and 8 TeV, this new measurement probes
  perturbative QCD at a higher centre-of-mass energy with a different composition
  of initial states. It reaches a precision of 0.2% for the normalized spectra at
  low values of $p_{ll}$. The data are compared with different QCD predictions.

description: Comparison of the normalized $p_{ll}$ distribution in the range $p_{ll}$
  > 10 GeV. The Born level combined measurement is compared with predictions by Sherpa
  v2.2.1, fixed-order NNLOjet and NNLOjet supplied with NLO electroweak corrections.
  The uncertainties in the measurement are shown as vertical bars and the uncertainties
  in the predictions are indicated by the coloured bands.
