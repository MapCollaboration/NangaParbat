# Short descrition of the fit that will appear in the report of the
# fit
Description: "Test fit with the Pavia 17 parameterisation (Jet)."

# Minimiser to be used for the fit. Possible options so far are
# 'minuit', 'ceres', and 'none'.
Minimiser: none

# Seed used with the random-number generator for the generation of the
# Monte Carlo replicas
Seed: '1234'

# Cut on qT / Q. This has to be smaller than the production cut used
# to produce the tables (now it is not used).
qToQmax: '0.8'

# Parameters to compute the cut qT / Q as PV17 fit.
cutParam: [0.2, 0.7, 0.5]

# Percentile cut (in percent) on the distribution of chi2's, error
# functions and parameters used to identify outliers.
Percentile cut: '5'

# Enable or disable the t0 prescription for the treatment of
# normalisation uncertantities and define the set of parameters to be
# used to compute the corresponding predictions (used only if the t0
# prescriprion is enabled). They have to be as many and ordered as the
# "Parameters" below.
t0prescription: false
t0parameters: [0.128, 0.285, 2.98, 0.173, 0.39, 0.125]

# Parameterisation to be fitted to data. This has to correspond to a
# derivarion of the "Parameterisation" class.
Parameterisation: PV17jet

# Fluctuate initial parameters according to their step
Paramfluct: false

# List of parameters to be fitted to data. This requires that the
# number and order of parameters matches those expected by the
# particular parameterisation being used.
