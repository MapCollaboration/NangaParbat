# Utilities

This folder contains the utility codes to be used to access the main functionalities of the code. The available codes are
the following.

- **AvailableDataSets**: this code is run as follows:
```Shell
./AvailableDataSets <path to data folder>
```
and displays the available datasets in the target folder ```<path to data folder>```. The target folder has be to be filled in by using the ```Filter``` utility (see below) in such a way that the data files are in the appropriate format.

- **AvailableParameterisations**: this code is run as follows:
```Shell
./AvailableParameterisations [python]
```
and displays the available parameterisations that can be used in a TMD fit along with a brief description. The optional string ```python``` produces an output that is more easily readable by the python command line interface.

- **AvailableBstar**: this code is run as follows:
```Shell
./AvailableBstar [python]
```
and displays the available b* presciptions available that can be used for the production of interpolation tables. The optional string ```python``` produces an output that is more easily readable by the python command line interface.

- **CreateTables**: this code produces interpolation tables and is run as follows:
```Shell
./CreateTables <configuration file> <path to data folder> <output folder> [optional selected datasets]
```
where ```<configuration file>``` has to point a file that contains the necessary information to do the calculation (*e.g.* see [config.yaml](../cards/config.yaml)), ```<path to data folder>``` is the path to the processed data files, and ```<output folder>``` points to the forlder where the interpolation tables will be placed. Finally, it is possibile to select one or more data sets through ```[optional selected datasets]``` for which interpolation tables will be produced. If left empty, interpolation tables for all the data files in the target data folder will be produced.

- **Filter**: this codes formats the raw data files in a way suitable for the code and is run as follows:
```Shell
./Filter <path to raw-data folder> <path to processed data>
```
where ```<path to raw-data folder>``` is the path to the raw data files and ```<path to processed data>``` is the path to the folder where the processed data files will be placed.

- **RunFit**: this code runs a fit and is run as follows:
```Shell
./RunFit <output dir> <fit configuration file> <path to data folder> <path to tables folder> <replica ID>
```
where ```<output dir>``` is the output directory, ```<configuration file>``` points to the fit configuration file (*e.g.* see [fitPV17.yaml](../cards/fitPV17.yaml)), ```<path to data folder>``` is the path to the data files to be fitted , ```<path to tables folder> ```is the path to the corresponding interpolation tables to be used, and ```<replica ID>``` is the replica ID number (0 correcponds to central values).

- **ComputeMeanReplica**: this code computes the mean replica, i.e. the average over some Monte Carlo replicas, and produces a report:
```Shell
./ComputeMeanReplica <output dir> <fit configuration file> <path to data folder> <path to tables folder> [optional replicas to be discarded]
```
as above, ```<output dir>``` is the output directory, ```<configuration file>``` points to the fit configuration file, ```<path to data folder>``` is the path to the data files to be fitted , and ```<path to tables folder> ```is the path to the corresponding interpolation tables to be used. In addition, it is possible to provide a list of replicas that have to be discarded when computing the average.

- **PlotTMDs**: this code produces plot of TMD distributions in transverse-momentum space and is run as follows:
```Shell
./PlotTMDs <configuration file> <output file> <pdf/ff> <flavour ID> <Scale in GeV> <value of x> <parameters file>
```
where ```<configuration file>``` has to point a file that contains the necessary information to do the calculation (*e.g.* see [config.yaml](../cards/config.yaml)), ```<output file>```is the output file, ```<pdf/ff>``` to plot either a TMDF PDF or a TMD FF, ```<flavour ID>``` is the flavour ID according to the LHAPDF nomenclature, ```<Scale in GeV>``` is the values of the final scale in GeV,  ```<value of x>``` is the value of Bjorken ```x```, and ```<parameters file>``` is the file containing the relevant information about the parameterisation and the sets of parameters to be used. For example:
```Shell
Parameterisation: "PV19"
Parameters: [[0.015552259, 3.0373071, 21.251885, 5.6171274, 0, 0.81410783, 0.81823693, 64.628302, 4.0249303, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.017413234, 2], [0.015552259, 3.0373071, 21.251885, 5.6171274, 0, 0.81410783, 0.81823693, 64.628302, 4.0249303, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.017413234, 2]]
```
This will result in two sets of predictions, one for each set of parameters. The code produces a file in the ```YAML``` format reporting the relevant kinematics and the predictions for a fixed set of values of ```qT``` in GeV of ```x``` time the TMD distribution.
